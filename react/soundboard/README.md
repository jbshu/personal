A React Soundboard (WIP):

- Upload your own sounds and play them
- Placeholder installation instructions
- In three terminals:
...terminal a) cd frontend -> run "npm start"
...terminal b) cd backend -> run "PORT=8000 node app.js"
...terminal c) cd backend -> run "nodemon app.js"

Notes:
- Adding more styling, improving installation process
