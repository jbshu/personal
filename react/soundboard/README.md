A React Soundboard (WIP):

1. Upload your own sounds and play them
2. Placeholder installation instructions
3. In three terminals:
..*terminal a) cd frontend -> run "npm start"
..*terminal b) cd backend -> run "PORT=8000 node app.js"
..*terminal c) cd backend -> run "nodemon app.js"

Notes:
- Adding more styling, improving installation process
