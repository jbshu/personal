A React Soundboard (WIP):

1. Upload your own sounds and play them
2. Placeholder installation instructions
3. In three terminals: <br/>
    - terminal a) cd frontend -> run "npm start" <br/>
    - terminal b) cd backend -> run "PORT=8000 node app.js" <br/>
    - terminal c) cd backend -> run "nodemon app.js" <br/>

Notes:
- TODO Adding more styling, improving installation process
